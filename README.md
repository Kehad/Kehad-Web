# Kehad Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and projects using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, built with **Vite** for a fast and modern development experience.

## Getting Started


Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Kehad/Kehad-Web.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd kehad
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

First, run the development server:


```
# My React Portfolio

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/App.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, providing a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.
